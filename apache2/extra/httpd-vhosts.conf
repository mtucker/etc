# Virtual Hosts
#
# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

# CW Environment Variable
SetEnv CW_ENV "Development"

# Constants to check the CW Environment Variable Against:
# Development: Workstations, etc, apps should use sandbox/testing settings
SetEnv CW_ENV_DEVELOPMENT_MODE "Development"
# Staging: QA, testing, sharing, www-d.charitywater.org, apps might use sandbox/testing settings OR live settings
# depending on where in the development lifecycle we are
SetEnv CW_ENV_STAGING_MODE "Staging"
# Production: charitywater.org, maps.charitywater.org, apps should use live settings for paypal, silverpop, etc
SetEnv CW_ENV_PRODUCTION_MODE "Production"

#
# Use name-based virtual hosting.
#
NameVirtualHost *:80

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.
